# Mathematical-Modelling 🧮🌍

This repository contains a range of mathematical modelling projects, showcasing how mathematics, coding, and simulation techniques can be applied to real-world phenomena. Projects range from epidemiological and geophysical simulations to recursive geometric patterns and programming fundamentals.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🦠 `Covid19-Modelling`
Simulates the spread and containment of COVID-19 using epidemiological models such as **SIR**, **SEIR**, or variants. May include parameter tuning, curve fitting to real data, and intervention simulations.

### 💻 `Programming-I`
Contains introductory programming exercises, likely focused on foundational logic, algorithms, or numerical methods. Useful for building the basics before diving into more complex models.

### 🔦 `Ray-Modelling`
Simulates the behaviour of light or sound rays under various conditions, such as reflection, refraction, or propagation through media. Could involve geometric optics or wave mechanics.

### 🔺 `Recursive-Triangles`
Models recursive geometrical structures, such as **Sierpiński triangles** or fractal patterns. Emphasises recursion, visualisation, and self-similarity concepts.

### 🌊 `SeismicWave-Modelling`
Simulates seismic wave propagation through different layers of the Earth. May use differential equations or finite difference methods to capture wave motion over space and time.
